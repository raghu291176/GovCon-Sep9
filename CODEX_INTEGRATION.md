# Codex Document Processing Integration

## Overview

The Codex Document Processing Workflow has been successfully integrated into the existing FAR Compliance Audit System SPA. This enhancement maintains the GL-first workflow while adding advanced OCR capabilities.

## Integration Approach

### âœ… Maintained Existing Architecture
- **Single Page Application (SPA)** with tab navigation unchanged
- **GL-first workflow** preserved - GL entries must be imported before documents
- **Existing API endpoints** enhanced rather than replaced
- **Backward compatibility** maintained for all existing functionality

### âœ… Enhanced `/api/docs/ingest` Route

The existing document upload route now includes:

1. **Enhanced OCR Pipeline**:
   ```
   Image/PDF â†’ Tesseract OCR â†’ Document Classification â†’ 
   â”œâ”€ Receipt/Invoice â†’ Azure Form Recognizer (if configured)
   â”œâ”€ General Document â†’ Mistral OCR (if configured)
   â””â”€ Fallback â†’ Existing Azure DI + LLM processing
   ```

2. **Improved GL Matching**:
   - Codex fuzzy matching with confidence scoring
   - Fallback to existing matching algorithm
   - Enhanced discrepancy detection

3. **Processing Metadata**:
   - Method used (tesseract, azure_receipt, azure_invoice, mistral_ocr)
   - Processing time and confidence scores
   - Match quality and discrepancies

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes
- `backend/server.js` - Enhanced `/api/docs/ingest` with Codex workflow
- `backend/services/` - New Codex service modules
- `package.json` - Added Codex dependencies

### Frontend Changes
- `app.js` - Enhanced upload feedback to show Codex processing
- `index.html` - Updated UI text to mention enhanced OCR

### New Service Modules
- `backend/services/ocrService.js` - Tesseract OCR integration
- `backend/services/documentProcessor.js` - Document classification and routing
- `backend/services/dataExtraction.js` - Structured data extraction
- `backend/services/glMatcher.js` - Enhanced fuzzy matching
- `backend/services/documentWorkflow.js` - Main processing pipeline

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Optional: Azure Form Recognizer (recommended for receipts/invoices)
AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_KEY=your-azure-key

# Optional: Mistral OCR (fallback for general documents)
MISTRAL_OCR_ENDPOINT=https://api.mistral.ai/v1/ocr
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-mistral-key
```

### Automatic Fallback Behavior
- **No configuration needed** - Tesseract OCR works out of the box
- **Graceful degradation** - Falls back to existing processing if Codex fails
- **Service detection** - Automatically uses available OCR services

## User Experience

### Enhanced Processing Flow
1. **Import GL entries** (required first step - unchanged)
2. **Upload documents** - Now shows "enhanced with Codex OCR" feedback
3. **Review matches** - Improved accuracy with confidence scores
4. **Dashboard & Reports** - Same functionality with better data

### UI Indicators
- Upload status shows: "Parsed documents (X enhanced with Codex OCR)"
- Console logging shows processing methods and confidence scores
- Existing linking and review interface unchanged

## Technical Benefits

### ðŸŽ¯ Improved Accuracy
- **Multi-stage OCR** with specialized processing for receipts/invoices
- **Fuzzy string matching** for vendor names with similarity scoring
- **Date and amount tolerance** matching with confidence levels
- **Discrepancy detection** for manual review

### ðŸš€ Performance
- **Parallel processing** of OCR engines
- **Intelligent routing** based on document type detection
- **Caching** of results to avoid re-processing

### ðŸ”’ Reliability
- **Graceful fallback** to existing methods if Codex fails
- **Error handling** with detailed logging
- **Backward compatibility** with existing workflows

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Basic Workflow
- [ ] Import GL entries from Excel
- [ ] Upload receipt images (JPG, PNG)
- [ ] Upload invoice PDFs
- [ ] Verify automatic GL matching
- [ ] Check Review tab shows linked documents

### âœ… Codex Features
- [ ] Console shows Codex processing logs
- [ ] Status messages show "enhanced with Codex OCR"
- [ ] Upload report includes Codex count
- [ ] Higher accuracy matching vs existing system

### âœ… Fallback Behavior
- [ ] Works without Azure Form Recognizer configured
- [ ] Works without Mistral OCR configured
- [ ] Falls back gracefully on OCR failures
- [ ] Maintains existing functionality

### âœ… Edge Cases
- [ ] Handles corrupted images
- [ ] Processes multi-page PDFs
- [ ] Works with documents containing no text
- [ ] Handles very large files

## Deployment

### Dependencies Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Service Configuration (Optional)
1. Configure Azure Form Recognizer for best receipt/invoice accuracy
2. Configure Mistral OCR for advanced document processing
3. Or use with just Tesseract OCR (works out of the box)

### Verification
1. Check `/api/document-processing/health` for service status
2. Upload test documents and verify processing methods in logs
3. Confirm GL matching improvements in Review tab

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- **Batch processing UI** for large document sets
- **Processing method selection** in upload interface
- **Confidence threshold configuration** in settings
- **Advanced matching rules** customization
- **Processing analytics** dashboard

### Integration Points
- Could add standalone `/api/document-processing/` endpoints for other applications
- Could expose Codex processing as a separate microservice
- Could add webhook notifications for processing completion

## Support

### Troubleshooting
- Check browser console for Codex processing logs
- Verify environment variables if using optional services
- Monitor server logs for detailed OCR processing information

### Performance Monitoring
- Processing times logged per document
- Confidence scores tracked for quality assessment
- Match success rates available in processing metadata
